/**
 * The actor schema has difficulty with distinguishing between agents, and id'd
 * groups since both can use the same keys.  This code will assist in validating
 * by comparing the values of those properties and applying rules which the
 * schema cannot.
 *
 * I'm thinking maybe have a good base schema that checks that only keys of
 *  objectType, name, ifi, and member exist, then read the value of objectType
 *  if it exists, and test against agent or group schema as needed.  That might
 *  be all that is needed.
 * The new schema, "actorANG.json", validates only that there is an actor object
 *  and that it contain no other properties other than those specifically
 *  allowed. Further testing for duplicate keys, and appropriate keys against
 *  agent or group schemas, and stronger type testing.
